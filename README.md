# Handwritten Letters Recognition using Fast Forward Neural Network

This project is a handwritten letters recognition system that utilizes a Fast Forward Neural Network (FFNN) to predict the letter drawn by the user. The system also includes a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to draw a letter and visualize the model's prediction.
